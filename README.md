# To-Do List
A simple command-line To-Do List application built using Python.
Tasks are stored in a text file so they remain saved even after closing the program.

## Features

* Add new tasks
* View all tasks
* Edit an existing task
* Delete a task
* Mark tasks as complete or incomplete
* Automatically saves tasks to a file
* Loads tasks when the program starts


## File Storage

Tasks are saved inside a file named **`tasks.txt`** with the format:

Task name | pending
Task name | completed

A file named `tasks.txt` will be created automatically if it does not exist.


## Example Usage

--- SIMPLE TODO LIST ---
1. View tasks
2. Add task
3. Edit task
4. Delete task
5. Update task (mark complete/incomplete)
0. Exit


## Future Improvements (Optional)

* Add priority (High/Medium/Low)
* Add due dates
* Sort tasks
* Add search feature
* Convert to a GUI (Tkinter or HTML)
